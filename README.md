Errbit: The open source self-hosted error catcher
=================================================

Errbit is an open source, self-hosted error catcher. It is [Hoptoad](http://hoptoadapp.com)
API compliant so you can just point the Hoptoad notifier at your Errbit server if you are
already using Hoptoad.

Errbit may be a good fit for you if:

* Your exceptions may contain sensitive data that you don't want sitting on someone else's server
* Your application is behind a firewall
* You'd like to brand your error catcher
* You want to add customer features to your error catcher
* You're crazy and love managing servers

If this doesn't sound like you, you should probably stick with [Hoptoad](http://hoptoadapp.com).
The [Thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com) guys offer great support for it and it is much more worry-free.
They have a free package and even offer a *"Hoptoad behind your firewall"* solution.

Installation
------------

*Note*: This app is intended for people with experience deploying and maintining
Rails applications. If you're uncomfortable with any step below then Errbit is not
for you. Checkout [Hoptoad](http://hoptoadapp.com) from the guys over at

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
