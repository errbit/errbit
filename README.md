Errbit [![TravisCI](https://secure.travis-ci.org/errbit/errbit.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/errbit/errbit)
======

**The open source self-hosted error catcher**

Errbit is a tool for collecting and managing errors from other applications.
It is [Airbrake](http://airbrakeapp.com) (formerly known as Hoptoad) API compliant,
so if you are already using Airbrake, you can just point hoptoad_notifier at your Errbit server.

Errbit may be a good fit for you if:

* Your exceptions may contain sensitive data that you don't want sitting on someone else's server
* Your application is behind a firewall
* You'd like to brand your error catcher
* You want to add customer features to your error catcher
* You're crazy and love managing servers

If this doesn't sound like you, you should probably stick with [Airbrake](http://airbrakeapp.com).
The [Thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com) guys offer great support for it and it is much more worry-free.
They have a free package and even offer a *"Airbrake behind your firewall"* solution.

Installation
------------

*Note*: This app is intended for people with experience deploying and maintining
Rails applications. If you're uncomfortable with any step below then Errbit is not
for you. Checkout [Airbrake](http://airbrakeapp.com) from the guys over at
[Thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com), which Errbit is based on.

**Set your local box or server(Ubuntu):**

  1. Install MongoDB. Follow the directions [here](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Ubuntu+and+Debian+packages), then:

         apt-get update
         apt-get install mongodb

  2. Install libxml and libcurl

         apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev

  3. Install Bundler

         gem install bundler

**Running Locally:**

  1. Install dependencies

         bundle install

  2. Bootstrap Errbit. This will copy over config.yml and also seed the database.

         rake errbit:bootstrap

  3. Update the config.yml and mongoid.yml files with information about your environment
  
  4. Start Server

         script/rails server

**Deploying:**

  1. Bootstrap Errbit. This will copy over config.yml and also seed the database.

         rake errbit:bootstrap

  2. Update the deploy.rb file with information about your server
  3. Setup server and deploy

         cap deploy:setup deploy

**Deploying to Heroku:**

  1. Clone the repository

         git clone http://github.com/jdpace/errbit.git

  2. Create & configure for Heroku

         gem install heroku
         heroku create example-errbit --stack cedar
         heroku addons:add mongohq:free
         heroku addons:add sendgrid:free
         heroku config:add HEROKU=true
         heroku config:add ERRBIT_HOST=some-hostname.example.com
         heroku config:add ERRBIT_EMAIL_FROM=example@example.com
         git push heroku master

  3. Seed the DB (_NOTE_: No bootstrap task is used on Heroku!)

         heroku run rake db:seed

  4. Enjoy!


**Configuring LDAP authentication:**

  1. In `config/config.yml`, set `user_has_username` to `true`
  2. Follow the instructions at https://github.com/cschiewek/devise_ldap_authenticatable
  to set up the devise_ldap_authenticatable gem.

  3. If you are authenticating by `username`, you will need to set the user's email
  after authentication. You can do this by adding the following lines to `app/models/user.rb`:

          before_save :set_ldap_email
          def set_ldap_email
            self.email = Devise::LdapAdapter.get_ldap_param(self.username, "mail")
          end


Upgrading
---------
*Note*: When upgrading Errbit, please run:

         1. git pull origin master ( assuming origin is the github.com/jdpace/errbit repo )
         2. rake db:migrate

If we change the way that data is stored, this will run any migrations to bring your database up to date.

Errbit for Errbit
-----------------

There is a central Errbit instance running on heroku at **http://errbit-central.heroku.com**.
Your Errbit instance will send it's errors there by default.
If you are running vanilla Errbit, it would be really helpful if you could leave these settings unchanged.
However, if you fork Errbit and are making lots of changes, please do point your errors back to your own instance of Errbit.


TODO
----

* Add ability for watchers to be configured for types of notifications they should receive
