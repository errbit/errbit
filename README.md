### The open source, self-hosted error catcher


Errbit is a tool for collecting and managing errors from other applications.
It is [Airbrake](http://airbrake.io) (formerly known as Hoptoad) API compliant,
so if you are already using Airbrake, you can just point the `airbrake` gem to your Errbit server.

Errbit may be a good fit for you if:

* Your exceptions may contain sensitive data that you don't want sitting on someone else's server
* Your application is behind a firewall
* You'd like to brand your error catcher
* You want to add customer features to your error catcher
* You're crazy and love managing servers

If this doesn't sound like you, you should probably stick with a hosted service such as
[Airbrake](http://airbrake.io).

Installation
------------

*Note*: This app is intended for people with experience deploying and maintaining
Rails applications. If you're uncomfortable with any step below then Errbit is not
for you.

**Set up your local box or server(Ubuntu):**

  * Install MongoDB. Follow the directions [here](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Ubuntu+and+Debian+packages), then:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install mongodb-10gen
```

  * Install libxml and libcurl

```bash
apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

  * Install Bundler

```bash
gem install bundler
```

**Running Locally:**

  * Install dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

  * Bootstrap Errbit. This will copy over config.yml and also seed the database.

```bash
rake errbit:bootstrap
```

  * Update the config.yml and mongoid.yml files with information about your environment

  * Start Server

```bash
script/rails server
```

Deploying:
----------

  * Copy `config/deploy.example.rb` to `config/deploy.rb`
  * Update the `deploy.rb` or `config.yml` file with information about your server
  * Setup server and deploy

```bash
cap deploy:setup deploy
```

(Note: The capistrano deploy script will automatically generate a unique secret token.)

**Deploying to Heroku:**

  * Clone the repository

```bash
git clone http://github.com/errbit/errbit.git
```
  * Update `db/seeds.rb` with admin credentials for your initial login.

  * Run `bundle`

  * Create & configure for Heroku

```bash
gem install heroku
heroku create example-errbit --stack cedar
heroku addons:add mongolab:sandbox
heroku addons:add sendgrid:starter
heroku config:add HEROKU=true
heroku config:add SECRET_TOKEN="$(bundle exec rake secret)"
heroku config:add ERRBIT_HOST=some-hostname.example.com
heroku config:add ERRBIT_EMAIL_FROM=example@example.com
git push heroku master
```

  * Seed the DB (_NOTE_: No bootstrap task is used on Heroku!)

```bash
heroku run rake db:seed
```

  * If you are using a free database on Heroku, you may want to periodically clear resolved errors to free up space.

    * With the heroku-scheduler add-on (replacement for cron):

    ```bash
    # Install the heroku scheduler add-on
    heroku addons:add scheduler:standard

    # Go open the dashboard to schedule the job.  You should use
    # 'rake errbit:db:clear_resolved' as the task command, and schedule it
    # at whatever frequency you like (once/day should work great).
    heroku addons:open scheduler
    ```

    * With the cron add-on:

    ```bash
    # Install the heroku cron addon, to clear resolved errors daily:
    heroku addons:add cron:daily
    ```

    * Or clear resolved errors manually:

    ```bash
    heroku run rake errbit:db:clear_resolved
    ```

  * You may want to enable the deployment hook for heroku :

```bash
heroku addons:add deployhooks:http --url="http://YOUR_ERRBIT_HOST/deploys.txt?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY"
```

  * You may also want to configure a different secret token for each deploy:

```bash
heroku config:add SECRET_TOKEN=some-secret-token
```

  * Enjoy!


Authentication
--------------

### Configuring GitHub authentication:

  * In `config/config.yml`, set `github_authentication` to `true`
  * Register your instance of Errbit at: https://github.com/settings/applications

If you hosted Errbit at errbit.example.com, you would fill in:

<table>
  <tr><th>URL:</th><td>http://errbit.example.com/</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Callback URL:</th><td>http://errbit.example.com/users/auth/github</td></tr>
</table>

  * After you have registered your app, set `github_client_id` and `github_secret`
    in `config/config.yml` with your app's Client ID and Secret key.


After you have followed these instructions, you will be able to **Sign in with GitHub** on the Login page.

You will also be able to link your GitHub profile to your user account on your **Edit profile** page.

If you have signed in with GitHub, or linked your GitHub profile, and the App has a GitHub repo configured,
then you will be able to create issues on GitHub.
You will still be able to create an issue on the App's configured issue tracker.

You can change the requested account permissions by setting `github_access_scope` to:

<table>
  <tr><th>['repo'] </th><td>Allow creating issues for public and private repos.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>['public_repo'] </th><td>Only allow creating issues for public repos.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>[] </th><td>No permission to create issues on any repos.</td></tr>
</table>


### GitHub authentication when served on Heroku

You will need to set up Heroku variables accordingly as described in [Configuring GitHub authentication](#configuring-github-authentication):

* GITHUB_AUTHENTICATION

```bash
heroku config:add GITHUB_AUTHENTICATION=true
```

* GITHUB_CLIENT_ID

```bash
heroku config:add GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=the_client_id_provided_by_GitHub
```

* GITHUB_SECRET

```bash
heroku config:add GITHUB_SECRET=the_secret_provided_by_GitHub
```

* GITHUB_ACCESS_SCOPE - set only one scope `repo` or `public_repo`. If you really need to put more than one, separate them with comma.

```bash
heroku config:add GITHUB_ACCESS_SCOPE=repo,public_repo
```

__Note__: To avoid restarting your Heroku app 4 times you can set Heroku variables in a single command, i.e:

```bash
heroku config:add GITHUB_AUTHENTICATION=true \
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=the_client_id_provided_by_GitHub \
GITHUB_SECRET=the_secret_provided_by_GitHub \
GITHUB_ACCESS_SCOPE=repo,public_repo
```

### Configuring LDAP authentication:

  * In `config/config.yml`, set `user_has_username` to `true`
  * Follow the instructions at https://github.com/cschiewek/devise_ldap_authenticatable
  to set up the devise_ldap_authenticatable gem.
  * Ensure to set ```config.ldap_create_user = true``` in ```config/initializers/devise.rb```, this enables creating the users from LDAP, otherwhise login will not work.
  * Create a new initializer (e.g. ```config/initializers/devise_ldap.rb```) and add the following code to enable ldap authentication in the User-model:
```ruby
Errbit::Config.devise_modules << :ldap_authenticatable
```

  * If you are authenticating by `username`, you will need to set the user's email manually
  before authentication. You must add the following lines to `app/models/user.rb`:

```ruby
  before_save :set_ldap_email
  def set_ldap_email
    self.email = Devise::LdapAdapter.get_ldap_param(self.username, "mail")
  end
```

  * Now login with your user from LDAP, this will create a user in the database
  * Open a rails console and set the admin flag for your user:

```ruby
user = User.first
user.admin = true
user.save!
```

Upgrading
---------
When upgrading Errbit, please run:

```bash
git pull origin master # assuming origin is the github.com/errbit/errbit repo
bundle install
rake db:migrate
```

If we change the way that data is stored, this will run any migrations to bring your database up to date.


User information in error reports
---------------------------------

Errbit can now display information about the user who experienced an error.
This gives you the ability to ask the user for more information,
and let them know when you've fixed the bug.

If you would like to include information about the current user in your error reports,
you can replace the `airbrake` gem in your Gemfile with `airbrake_user_attributes`,
which wraps the `airbrake` gem and injects user information.
It will inject information about the current user into the error report
if your Rails app's controller responds to a `#current_user` method.
The user's attributes are filtered to remove authentication fields.

If user information is received with an error report,
it will be displayed under the *User Details* tab:


![User details tab](http://errbit.github.com/errbit/images/error_user_information.png)

(This tab will be hidden if no user information is available.)

Adding javascript errors notifications
--------------------------------------

Errbit easily supports javascript errors notifications. You just need to add `config.js_notifier = true` to the errbit initializer in the rails app.

```
Errbit.configure do |config|
  config.host    = 'YOUR-ERRBIT-HOST'
  config.api_key = 'YOUR-PROJECT-API-KEY'
  config.js_notifier = true
end
```

Then get the `notifier.js` from `errbit/public/javascript/notifier.js` and add to `application.js` on your rails app or include `http://YOUR-ERRBIT-HOST/javascripts/notifier.js` on your `application.html.erb.`

What if Errbit has an error?
----------------------------

Errbit will log it's own errors to an internal app named **Self.Errbit**.
The **Self.Errbit** app will be automatically created whenever the first error happens.

If your Errbit instance has logged an error, we would appreciate a bug report on GitHub Issues.
You can post this manually at [https://github.com/errbit/errbit/issues](https://github.com/errbit/errbit/issues),
or you can set up the GitHub Issues tracker for your **Self.Errbit** app:

  * Go to the **Self.Errbit** app's edit page. If that app does not exist yet, go to the apps page and click **Add a new App** to create it. (You can also create it by running `rake airbrake:test`.)

  * In the **Issue Tracker** section, click **GitHub Issues**.

  * Fill in the **Account/Repository** field with **errbit/errbit**.

  * Fill in the **Username** field with your github username.

  * If you are logged in on [GitHub](https://github.com), you can find your **API Token** on this page: [https://github.com/account/admin](https://github.com/account/admin).

  * Save the settings by clicking **Update App** (or **Add App**)

  * You can now easily post bug reports to GitHub Issues by clicking the **Create Issue** button on a **Self.Errbit** error.
