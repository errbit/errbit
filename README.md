Errbit [![TravisCI](http://travis-ci.org/errbit/errbit.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/errbit/errbit)
======

**The open source self-hosted error catcher**

Errbit is a tool for collecting and managing errors from other applications.
It is [Airbrake](http://airbrakeapp.com) (formerly known as Hoptoad) API compliant,
so if you are already using Airbrake, you can just point hoptoad_notifier at your Errbit server.

Errbit may be a good fit for you if:

* Your exceptions may contain sensitive data that you don't want sitting on someone else's server
* Your application is behind a firewall
* You'd like to brand your error catcher
* You want to add customer features to your error catcher
* You're crazy and love managing servers

If this doesn't sound like you, you should probably stick with [Airbrake](http://airbrakeapp.com).
The [Thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com) guys offer great support for it and it is much more worry-free.
They have a free package and even offer a *"Airbrake behind your firewall"* solution.

Installation
------------

*Note*: This app is intended for people with experience deploying and maintining
Rails applications. If you're uncomfortable with any step below then Errbit is not
for you. Checkout [Airbrake](http://airbrakeapp.com) from the guys over at
[Thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com), which Errbit is based on.

**Set up your local box or server(Ubuntu):**

  1. Install MongoDB. Follow the directions [here](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Ubuntu+and+Debian+packages), then:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install mongodb
```

  2. Install libxml and libcurl

```bash
apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

  3. Install Bundler

```bash
gem install bundler
```

**Running Locally:**

  1. Install dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

  2. Bootstrap Errbit. This will copy over config.yml and also seed the database.

```bash
rake errbit:bootstrap
```

  3. Update the config.yml and mongoid.yml files with information about your environment

  4. Start Server

```bash
script/rails server
```

**Deploying:**

  1. Bootstrap Errbit. This will copy over config.yml and also seed the database.

```bash
rake errbit:bootstrap
```

  2. Update the deploy.rb file with information about your server
  3. Setup server and deploy

```bash
cap deploy:setup deploy
```

**Deploying to Heroku:**

  1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone http://github.com/errbit/errbit.git
```

  2. Create & configure for Heroku

```bash
gem install heroku
heroku create example-errbit --stack cedar
heroku addons:add mongohq:free
heroku addons:add sendgrid:free
heroku config:add HEROKU=true
heroku config:add ERRBIT_HOST=some-hostname.example.com
heroku config:add ERRBIT_EMAIL_FROM=example@example.com
git push heroku master
```

  3. Seed the DB (_NOTE_: No bootstrap task is used on Heroku!)

```bash
heroku run rake db:seed
```

  4. If you are using a free database on Heroku, you may want to periodically clear resolved errors to free up space.

```bash
# Install the heroku cron addon, to clear resolved errors daily:
heroku addons:add cron:daily

# Or, clear resolved errors manually:
heroku rake errbit:db:clear_resolved
```

  5. Enjoy!


**Configuring LDAP authentication:**

  1. In `config/config.yml`, set `user_has_username` to `true`
  2. Follow the instructions at https://github.com/cschiewek/devise_ldap_authenticatable
  to set up the devise_ldap_authenticatable gem.

  3. If you are authenticating by `username`, you will need to set the user's email
  after authentication. You can do this by adding the following lines to `app/models/user.rb`:

```ruby
  before_save :set_ldap_email
  def set_ldap_email
    self.email = Devise::LdapAdapter.get_ldap_param(self.username, "mail")
  end
```

Upgrading
---------
*Note*: When upgrading Errbit, please run:

```bash
git pull origin master # assuming origin is the github.com/errbit/errbit repo
rake db:migrate
```

If we change the way that data is stored, this will run any migrations to bring your database up to date.

What if Errbit has an error?
----------------------------

Errbit will log it's own errors to an internal app named **Self.Errbit**.
The **Self.Errbit** app will be automatically created whenever the first error happens.

If your Errbit instance has logged an error, we would appreciate a bug report on Github Issues.
You can post this manually at [https://github.com/errbit/errbit/issues](https://github.com/errbit/errbit/issues),
or you can set up the Github Issues tracker for your **Self.Errbit** app:

  1. Go to the **Self.Errbit** app's edit page. If that app does not exist yet, go to the apps page and click **Add a new App** to create it. (You can also create it by running `rake hoptoad:test`.)

  2. In the **Issue Tracker** section, click **Github Issues**.

  3. Fill in the **Account/Repository** field with **errbit/errbit**.

  4. Fill in the **Username** field with your github username.

  5. On [https://github.com](https://github.com), click "Account Settings", and then "Account Admin" to find your Github **API Token**.

  6. Save the settings by clicking **Update App** (or **Add App**)

  7. You will now be able to easily post a bug report to Github Issues.

Contributing
------------

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
