# Uncomment each configuration one by one to switch to the new default.
# Once your application is ready to run with all new defaults, you can remove
# this file and set the `config.load_defaults` to `7.1`.

###
# ** Please read carefully, this must be configured in config/application.rb **
#
# Change the format of the cache entry.
#
# Changing this default means that all new cache entries added to the cache
# will have a different format that is not supported by Rails 7.0
# applications.
#
# Only change this value after your application is fully deployed to Rails 7.1
# and you have no plans to rollback.
# When you're ready to change format, add this to `config/application.rb` (NOT
# this file):
#   config.active_support.cache_format_version = 7.1
