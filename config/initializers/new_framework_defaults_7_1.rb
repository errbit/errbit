# No longer add autoloaded paths into `$LOAD_PATH`. This means that you won't be able
# to manually require files that are managed by the autoloader, which you shouldn't do anyway.
#
# This will reduce the size of the load path, making `require` faster if you don't use bootsnap, or reduce the size
# of the bootsnap cache if you use it.
#
# To set this configuration, add the following line to `config/application.rb` (NOT this file):
#   config.add_autoload_paths_to_load_path = false

# Active Record Encryption now uses SHA-256 as its hash digest algorithm.
#
# There are 3 scenarios to consider.
#
# 1. If you have data encrypted with previous Rails versions, and you have
# +config.active_support.key_generator_hash_digest_class+ configured as SHA1 (the default
# before Rails 7.0), you need to configure SHA-1 for Active Record Encryption too:
#++
# Rails.application.config.active_record.encryption.hash_digest_class = OpenSSL::Digest::SHA1
#
# 2. If you have +config.active_support.key_generator_hash_digest_class+ configured as SHA256 (the new default
# in 7.0), then you need to configure SHA-256 for Active Record Encryption:
#++
# Rails.application.config.active_record.encryption.hash_digest_class = OpenSSL::Digest::SHA256
#
# 3. If you don't currently have data encrypted with Active Record encryption, you can disable this setting to
# configure the default behavior starting 7.1+:
#++

###
# No longer run after_commit callbacks on the first of multiple Active Record

# Configures SQLite with a strict strings mode, which disables double-quoted string literals.
#
# SQLite has some quirks around double-quoted string literals.
# It first tries to consider double-quoted strings as identifier names, but if they don't exist
# it then considers them as string literals. Because of this, typos can silently go unnoticed.
# For example, it is possible to create an index for a non existing column.
# See https://www.sqlite.org/quirks.html#double_quoted_string_literals_are_accepted for more details.

###
# Specify the default serializer used by `MessageEncryptor` and `MessageVerifier`
# instances.
#
# The legacy default is `:marshal`, which is a potential vector for
# deserialization attacks in cases where a message signing secret has been
# leaked.
#
# In Rails 7.1, the new default is `:json_allow_marshal` which serializes and
# deserializes with `ActiveSupport::JSON`, but can fall back to deserializing
# with `Marshal` so that legacy messages can still be read.
#
# In Rails 7.2, the default will become `:json` which serializes and
# deserializes with `ActiveSupport::JSON` only.
#
# Alternatively, you can choose `:message_pack` or `:message_pack_allow_marshal`,
# which serialize with `ActiveSupport::MessagePack`. `ActiveSupport::MessagePack`
# can roundtrip some Ruby types that are not supported by JSON, and may provide
# improved performance, but it requires the `msgpack` gem.
