  You must generate a unique secret token for your Errbit instance.

  If you are deploying via capistrano, please ensure that your `config/deploy.rb` contains
  the new `errbit:setup_configs` and `errbit:symlink_configs` tasks from `config/deploy.example.rb`.
  Next time you deploy, your secret token will be automatically generated.

  If you are deploying to Heroku, please run the following command to set your secret token:
      heroku config:add SECRET_TOKEN="$(bundle exec rake secret)"

  If you are deploying in some other way, please run the following command to generate a new secret token,
  and commit the new `config/initializers/secret_token.rb`:

      echo "Errbit::Application.config.secret_token = '$(bundle exec rake secret)'" > config/initializers/secret_token.rb

  ERROR
