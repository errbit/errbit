= Email Spec

A collection of RSpec matchers and Cucumber steps to make testing emails go smoothly.

This library works with ActionMailer and Pony.  When using it with ActionMailer it works with
DelayedJob, ActiveRecord Mailer, and action_mailer_cache_delivery.

When using the action_mailer_cache_delivery library you must use this fork:
http://github.com/liangzan/action_mailer_cache_delivery

If you are testing emails in conjunction with an automated browser solution, like Selenium,
you will want to use action_mailer_cache_delivery in your test environment.  (This is
because your test process and server processes are distinct and therefore need an
intermediate store for the emails.) DelayedJob and ActiveRecord Mailer will also work but
you generally don't want to include those projects unless you need them in production.

== Setup

  script/plugin install git://github.com/bmabey/email-spec.git

=== Gem Setup

  gem install email_spec

  # Gemfile
  group :test do
    gem 'email_spec'
  end

=== Cucumber

To use the steps in features put the following in your env.rb:

  # Make sure this require is after you require cucumber/rails/world.
  require 'email_spec' # add this line if you use spork
  require 'email_spec/cucumber'

This will load all the helpers that the steps rely on.
It will also add a Before hook for Cucumber so that emails are cleared at the start of each scenario.

Then:

  rails generate email_spec:steps

This will give you a bunch of steps to get started with in step_definitions/email_steps.rb

By default, the generated file will look for email to example@example.com. You can either change this
by editing the current_email_address method in email_steps.rb, or by simply specifying the target
email in your features:

  Scenario: A new person signs up
      Given I am at "/"
      When I fill in "Email" with "quentin@example.com"
      And I press "Sign up"
      And "quentin@example.com" should receive an email   # Specify who should receive the email

=== RSpec

First you need to require email_spec in your spec_helper.rb:

  require "email_spec"

You will then need to include EmailSpec::Helpers and EmailSpec::Matchers in your example groups.
If you want to have access to the helpers and matchers in all of your examples you can do the following in your spec_helper.rb:

  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.include(EmailSpec::Helpers)
    config.include(EmailSpec::Matchers)
  end

Otherwise, you will need to include them in the example groups you wish to use them:

  describe "Signup Email" do
    include EmailSpec::Helpers
    include EmailSpec::Matchers
    ...
  end

== Usage

=== Cucumber

  Scenario: A new person signs up
      Given I am at "/"
      When I fill in "Email" with "quentin@example.com"
      And I press "Sign up"
      And I should receive an email
      When I open the email
      Then I should see "confirm" in the email body
      When I follow "confirm" in the email
      Then I should see "Confirm your new account"

For more examples, check out examples/rails_root in the source for a small example app that implements these steps.

=== RSpec

==== Testing In Isolation
It is often useful to test your mailers in isolation.  You can accomplish this by using mocks to verify that the mailer is being called in the correct place and then write focused examples for the actual mailer.  This is a simple example from the sample app found in the gem:

Verify that the mailer is used correctly in the controller (this would apply to a model as well):

  describe "POST /signup (#signup)" do
    it "should deliver the signup email" do
      # expect
      UserMailer.should_receive(:deliver_signup).with("email@example.com", "Jimmy Bean")
      # when
      post :signup, "Email" => "email@example.com", "Name" => "Jimmy Bean"
    end
  end

Examples for the #signup method in UserMailer:

  describe "Signup Email" do
    include EmailSpec::Helpers
    include EmailSpec::Matchers
    include ActionController::UrlWriter

    before(:all) do
      @email = UserMailer.create_signup("jojo@yahoo.com", "Jojo Binks")
    end

    it "should be set to be delivered to the email passed in" do
      @email.should deliver_to("jojo@yahoo.com")
    end

    it "should contain the user's message in the mail body" do
      @email.should have_body_text(/Jojo Binks/)
    end

    it "should contain a link to the confirmation link" do
      @email.should have_body_text(/#{confirm_account_url}/)
    end

    it "should have the correct subject" do
      @email.should have_subject(/Account confirmation/)
    end

  end

==== Using the helpers when not testing in isolation

Don't. :)  Seriously, if you do just take a look at the helpers and use them as you wish.
