  This release makes email-spec compatible with Rails 3 and RSpec 2.x.

  IMPORTANT: As of 1.0 email-spec is no longer backwards compatible wit Rails 2.x.  I will be maintaining a 0.6

    * Maxim Chernyak for the initial conversion work to Rails 3
    * Tim Harper for ironing out various matcher bugs

      DelayedJob support and worked through all the bundler issues the project was facing.

This release is a general refactoring of the steps and helpers.
The example rails app was also updated to use the lateset rails and webrat.  It also takes advantages
and the newer step definistions including the new third-person forms.

Some of the generated steps are being removed in favor of some of the newer ones.  The older ones
will remain until 0.4.0 but will issue deprecation warnings.

Big shoutout to Kieran Pilkington who did the majority of work for this release.

      Then they should see "Account has been created" in the subject
