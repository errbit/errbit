I was disappointed.  It seems the only reason the engine relies on AR is to provide History functionality.  I would argue that having the History in a database, and therefore tying the app to AR & SQL, isn't worth it.  How about we change it to just dump to a CSV and remove the AR dep?\n\n$0.02","title":"Use OrmAdapter instead of talking directly to ActiveRecord","updated_at":"2011/01/14 11:16:57 -0800","user":"ryana","labels":["@ml","enhancement"],"state":"open"},{"gravatar_id":"07fb1f108e968f7b8573307eefddd66f","position":43.0,"number":220,"votes":1,"created_at":"2011/01/03 05:56:35 -0800","comments":3,"body":"Hi\r\n\r\nI added AbstracObject class to replace direct ActiveRecord calls in the controller. I moved the code for creating, updating and destroying from the controller to this class. AbstractObject should be good place for something like https://github.com/ianwhite/orm_adapter. I think that moving everything related to the history from MainController to AbstracObject is also good idea.

It searches for \"class <blah>\" inside <rails_root>/app/models/**/*.rb. However, some of those discoveries were inside comments/quotes.\r\n\r\nAs such, I've modified it to use the union of those finds and the result of Module.constants.\r\nI also added a bit of \"connascence\" in that I made the self.lookup method accept a true/false flag for determining when to throw an exception -- which it still does by default.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJonathan\r\n\r\np.s.\r\n(I'm new to open-source, so feel free to give me feedback positive/negative.)\r\n","title":"Bug-Fix w/ discovering ActiveRecord models","updated_at":"2011/01/10 20:10:15 -0800","user":"JayTeeSF","labels":[],"state":"open"}]}
