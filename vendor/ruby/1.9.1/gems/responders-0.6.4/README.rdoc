== Responders

A set of responders modules to dry up your Rails 3 app. If you are interested in the version
to be used with Rails 2.3 together with Inherited Resources, please check this branch instead:

  http://github.com/plataformatec/responders/tree/v0.4

* FlashResponder - Sets the flash based on the controller action and resource status.
  For instance, if you do: respond_with(@post) on a POST request and the resource @post
  does not contain errors, it will automatically set the flash message to
  "Post was successfully created" as long as you configure your I18n file:

    flash:
      actions:
        create:
          notice: "%{resource_name} was successfully created."
        update:
          notice: "%{resource_name} was successfully updated."
        destroy:
          notice: "%{resource_name} was successfully destroyed."
          alert: "%{resource_name} could not be destroyed."

  In case the resource contains errors, you should use the failure key on I18n. This is
  useful to dry up flash messages from your controllers. If you need a specific message
  for a controller, let's say, for PostsController, you can also do:

    flash:
      posts:
        create:
          notice: "Your post was created and will be published soon"

  This responder is activated in all non get requests. By default it will use the keys
  :notice and :alert, but they can be changed in your application:

	config.responders.flash_keys = [ :success, :failure ]

  Or:

    Responders::FlashResponder.flash_keys = [ :success, :failure ]

* HttpCacheResponder - Automatically adds Last-Modified headers to API requests. This
  allows clients to easily query the server if a resource changed and if the client tries
  to retrieve a resource that has not been modified, it returns not_modified status.

* CollectionResponder - Makes your create and update action redirect to the collection on success.

== Configuring your own responder

The first step is instal responders gem and configure it in your application:

  gem install responders

Responders only provides a set of modules, to use them, you have to create your own
responder. This can be done inside the lib folder for example:

  # lib/app_responder.rb
  class AppResponder < ActionController::Responder
    include Responders::FlashResponder
    include Responders::HttpCacheResponder
  end

And then you need to configure your application to use it:

  # app/controllers/application_controller.rb
  require "app_responder"

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    self.responder = AppResponder
    respond_to :html
  end

Or, for your convenience, just do:

  rails generate responders:install

== Controller method

This gem also includes the controller method 'responders', which allows you to cherry-pick which responders you want included in your controller.

  class InvitationsController < ApplicationController
    responders :flash, :http_cache
  end

== Generator

This gem also includes a responders controller generator, so your scaffold can be customized
to use respond_with instead of default respond_to blocks. Installing this gem automatically
sets the generator.
