=== What is this?

For the best HTML e-mail delivery results, CSS should be inline. This is a 
huge pain and a simple newsletter becomes un-managable very quickly. This 
script is my solution.

* CSS styles are converted to inline style attributes
  Checks <tt>style</tt> and <tt>link[rel=stylesheet]</tt> tags and preserves existing inline attributes
* Relative paths are converted to absolute paths
  Checks links in <tt>href</tt>, <tt>src</tt> and CSS <tt>url('')</tt>
* CSS properties are checked against e-mail client capabilities
  Based on the Email Standards Project's guides
* A plain text version is created
  Optional

=== Premailer 2.0 is coming

I'm looking for input on a version 2.0 update to Premailer.  PLease visit the {Premailer 2.0 Planning Page}[https://github.com/alexdunae/premailer/wiki/Premailer-2.0-Planning] and give me your feedback.

=== Installation

Download the Premailer gem from RubyGems.

    sudo gem install premailer

=== Example
  premailer = Premailer.new('http://example.com/myfile.html', :warn_level => Premailer::Warnings::SAFE)

  # Write the HTML output
  fout = File.open("output.html", "w")
  fout.puts premailer.to_inline_css
  fout.close

  # Write the plain-text output
  fout = File.open("ouput.txt", "w")
  fout.puts premailer.to_plain_text
  fout.close

  # Output any CSS warnings
  premailer.warnings.each do |w|
    puts "#{w[:message]} (#{w[:level]}) may not render properly in #{w[:clients]}"
  end
  
=== Premailer-specific CSS

Premailer looks for a few CSS attributes that make working with tables a bit easier.

+-premailer-width+::        Available on <tt>table</tt>, <tt>th</tt> and <tt>td</tt> elements
+-premailer-height+::       Available on <tt>table</tt>, <tt>tr</tt>, <tt>th</tt> and <tt>td</tt> elements
+-premailer-cellpadding+::  Available on <tt>table</tt> elements
+-premailer-cellspacing+::  Available on <tt>table</tt> elements

Each of these CSS declarations will be copied to appropriate element's attribute. 

For example

  table { -premailer-cellspacing: 5; -premailer-width: 500;}

will result in 

  <table cellspacing='5' width='500'>


=== Contributions

Contributions are most welcome.  Premailer was rotting away in a private SVN repository for too long and could use some TLC.  Fork and patch to your heart's content.  Please don't increment the version numbers, though.

A few areas that are particularly in need of love:
* Improved test coverage
* Move un-repeated background images defined in CSS to <tt><td background=""></tt> for Outlook
