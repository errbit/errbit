= Rack::SslEnforcer

Rack::SslEnforcer is a simple Rack middleware to enforce SSL connections. As of Version 0.2.0, Rack::SslEnforcer marks
Cookies as secure by default (HSTS must be set manually).

Tested on Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2, REE, JRuby and Rubinius.

== Installation

  gem install rack-ssl-enforcer


== Basic Usage

  require 'rack/ssl-enforcer'
  use Rack::SslEnforcer

Or, if you are using Bundler, just add this to your Gemfile:

  gem 'rack-ssl-enforcer'

To use Rack::SslEnforcer in your Rails application, add the following line to your application
config file (<tt>config/application.rb</tt> for Rails 3, <tt>config/environment.rb</tt> for Rails 2):

  config.middleware.use Rack::SslEnforcer

If all you want is SSL for your whole application, you are done! However, you can specify some


== Options

You might need the :redirect_to option if the requested URL can't be determined (e.g. if using a proxy).

  config.middleware.use Rack::SslEnforcer, :redirect_to => 'https://example.org'

You can also define specific regex patterns or paths or hosts to redirect.

  config.middleware.use Rack::SslEnforcer, :only => /^\/admin\//
  config.middleware.use Rack::SslEnforcer, :only => "/login"
  config.middleware.use Rack::SslEnforcer, :only => ["/login", /\.xml$/]
  config.middleware.use Rack::SslEnforcer, :only_hosts => 'api.example.com'
  config.middleware.use Rack::SslEnforcer, :only_hosts => [/[www|api]\.example\.org$/, 'example.com']
  config.middleware.use Rack::SslEnforcer, :except_hosts => 'help.example.com'
  config.middleware.use Rack::SslEnforcer, :except_hosts => /[help|blog]\.example\.com$/

Note: hosts options take precedence over the path options. See tests for examples.

Use the :strict option to force http for all requests not matching your :only specification

  config.middleware.use Rack::SslEnforcer, :only => ["/login", /\.xml$/], :strict => true
  config.middleware.use Rack::SslEnforcer, :only_hosts => 'api.example.com', :strict => true

Or in the case where you have matching urls with different methods (Rails RESTful routes: get#users post#users || get#user/:id put#user/:id) you may need to post and put to secure but redirect to http on get.

  config.middleware.use Rack::SslEnforcer, :only => [%r{^/users/}], :mixed => true

The above will allow you to post/put from the secure/non-secure urls keeping the original schema.

To set HSTS expiry and subdomain inclusion (defaults: one year, true). Strict option disables HSTS.

  config.middleware.use Rack::SslEnforcer, :hsts => { :expires => 500, :subdomains => false }
  config.middleware.use Rack::SslEnforcer, :hsts => true # equivalent to { :expires => 31536000, :subdomains => true }

Finally you might want to share a cookie based session between http and https.
This is not possible by default with Rack::SslEnforcer for security reasons.
See: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Cookie_theft_and_session_hijacking]

Nevertheless, you can set the option :force_secure_cookies to false in order to be able to share a cookie based session between http and https:

  config.middleware.use Rack::SslEnforcer, :only => "/login", :force_secure_cookies => false

But be aware that if you do so, you have to make sure that the content of you cookie is encoded.
This can be done using a coder with Rack::Session::Cookie.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version,
  that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
