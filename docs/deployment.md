# Deployment Notes
There are any number of ways to deploy Errbit, but official support is limited
to heroku and capistrano.

See specific notes on deployment via:
- [heroku](deployment/heroku.md)
- [dokku](deployment/dokku.md)
- [capistrano](deployment/capistrano.md)

You can use a process manager to deploy Errbit, but Errbit doesn't maintain
support for any specific process manager. But if you use systemd, @nofxx has
been kind enough to share:
