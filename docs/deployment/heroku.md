# Deploy to Heroku

## The Easy Way

If you just want to get started with Errbit and you're not sure how to proceed,
you can use this deploy button to get a basic deployment running on Heroku.

You will need to spin up a MongoDB server if you don't have one at your disposal already.
Free clusters up to 512MB are available with MongoDB Atlas [Here](https://cloud.mongodb.com)

## MongoDB Atlas Setup for Quick Deployment

Upon creating an account, you will be greeted with this page. Make sure you select Starter Cluster.

After this, you will be taken to the below screen:

Select one of the servers marked with `FREE TIER AVAILABLE` and click on `Create Cluster`. It will only take a couple of minutes to configure everything for you.

Follow the "Getting Started" tutorial on the bottom left.

### Create a database user

Go to the `Database Access` section in the `security` tab. Click on `+ Add New User` to create a new user, whereupon a new screen will pop up. Select `Read and write to any database`, so the bot can properly store the data. Choose a username and password, but make sure they both **don't contain any special character** like `!`, `-`, `?`. Copy the password into your notepad.

Finally, click `Add User` to finish the creation.

### Whitelist all IP's

Go to the `Network Access` section in the `security` tab. Click on `+ Add IP Address` to add an IP address, whereupon a new screen will pop up. Click the `Allow Access From Everywhere` button and `0.0.0.0/0` should appear in the `Whitelist Entry`. Otherwise, make sure to put input that manually. Finally, click `Confirm` to confirm your changes.

### Obtain a connection string

The last part is to generate a Mongo URI. Go to the `Clusters` section in the `Atlas` tab. Click on `Connect` on the left side of your Cluster dashboard. This will open up a new screen where you have three options. For our purposes, select the middle option `Connect Your Application`.

![Connection String](./example/atlas5.png)

Be sure to select Ruby and Version 2.5 or later.
You need to copy the connection string, which can be easily done by clicking the `Copy` button. Then replace `<password>` with the password for your user, which you set earlier. Paste the URI in your notepad.

The final URI looks similar to this: `mongodb+srv://Username:MyPassword@modmail-kjvn21.mongodb.net/`.

Now that you have your connection URI, click the deploy button below and start your app deployment. Paste the entire URI you obtained from above into the MONGODB_URI Text box.

After deploying the application, you still need to run `rake errbit:bootstrap`
to create indexes and get your admin user set up. You can do this by clicking the `Run Console` button in the More dropdown button of your new Heroku app. Then paste the rake command above and be sure to copy your admin credentials!

## The Hard Way

We designed Errbit to work well with Heroku. These instructions should result
in a working deploy, but you should modify them to suit your needs:

### Clone and prepare the source code repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:errbit/errbit.git
cd errbit
```

- Update `db/seeds.rb` with admin credentials for your initial login

Commit the results:
```bash
git commit -m "Update db/seeds.rb with initial login"
```

### Install the heroku toolbelt
[toolbelt.heroku.com](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)

### Create an app on Heroku and push the source code. Use the above documentation to obtain a MongoDB URI from MongoDB Atlas if you don't have one.
```bash
heroku apps:create
heroku addons:create sendgrid:starter
heroku config:set GEMFILE_RUBY_VERSION=2.5.1
heroku config:set SECRET_KEY_BASE="$(bundle exec rake secret)"
heroku config:set MONGODB_URI="<URI HERE>"
heroku config:set ERRBIT_HOST=some-hostname.example.com
heroku config:set ERRBIT_EMAIL_FROM=example@example.com
heroku config:set EMAIL_DELIVERY_METHOD=smtp SMTP_SERVER=smtp.sendgrid.net
git push heroku master
```

### Prepare the DB

```bash
heroku run rake errbit:bootstrap
```

### Schedule recurring tasks
You may want to periodically clear resolved errors to free up space. For that
you have a few options:

Option 1. With the heroku-scheduler add-on (replacement for cron):

```bash
# Install the heroku scheduler add-on
heroku addons:create scheduler:standard

# Go open the dashboard to schedule the job.  You should use
# 'rake errbit:clear_resolved' as the task command, and schedule it
# at whatever frequency you like (once/day should work great).
heroku addons:create scheduler
```

Option 2. With the cron add-on:

```bash
# Install the heroku cron addon, to clear resolved errors daily:
heroku addons:create cron:daily
```

Option 3. Clear resolved errors manually:

```bash
heroku run rake errbit:clear_resolved
```
