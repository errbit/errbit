module NavigationHelper

  # Or on certain action(s) in a certain controller
  #  - active_if_here(:users => :index, :blogs => [:create, :update], :comments)
  #
  # Useful for navigation elements that have a certain state when your on a given page.
  # Returns nil if there are no matches so when passing:
  #  link_to 'link', '#', :class => active_if_here(:users)
  # will not even set a class attribute if nil is passed back.
